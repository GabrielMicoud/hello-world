# Hello world !

I'm Gaby, i'm a student in a cool school full of fools.
I like trains.
I also like lotr, anime stuff, Touhou and memes.
If you want to send me letters, guitars or even ballistic missiles, you can find me in France. Yeah i'm a bit of a baguette myself.

I'm not a beginner in coding, but i can start the apocalypse if i want to execute a "hello world" program while i'm exhausted as hell.
And when i'm not shitposting in readme files, i can (try to) bring some ideas to reality with code: mostly C, C++, Python and JavaScript.

Cereals before milk please.

See you all and have a nice day.
