# Hello world !

I'm **Gabz**, i'm a student in a computer science school, and i'm also a musician.
I like trains.
I also like lotr, anime stuff, Touhou and memes.
If you want to send me letters, guitars or even ballistic missiles, you can find me in France. Yeah i'm a bit of a baguette myself.

I'm not a beginner in coding (i recently found an internship, and as far as i know they didn't send me to jail because of some hella bad code, so it's good news), but i can trigger the apocalypse when i want to execute a "hello world" program while being exhausted as hell.
And when i'm not shitposting in readme files, i can (try to) bring some ideas to reality with code: mostly Java, C++ and JavaScript.

Cereals before milk please.

See you all and have a nice day.

PS: i lost the Game
